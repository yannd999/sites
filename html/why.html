					“What’s actually important is that the couple – regardless of their ages – have the same desires for the future. If you don’t, then the relationship will undoubtedly fail. It’s common in age-gap relationships for one half of the couple to want children, whereas their partner might have a ‘been there, done that’ attitude. These sort of things need to be discussed in advance to make you’re on the same page.”

					You must view your partner as a full-grown adult, rather than a "progeny" to teach, shape, or mold. No one wants to be scolded or patronized for acting a certain way, or saying certain things—especially when you're the one who's older and making admonishments in the name of age-earned wisdom and experience. Likewise, if you're the younger person, avoid referring to your partner as "boomer," "old-timer," or any other turn of phrase that implies their outlook is too traditional, or passé. Age alone isn't the only barometer of maturity.
				</p><br>

				<p>
					Equalize the age gap by focusing on your mutual interests. Spend time doing things you both love, and your difference in age will seemingly melt away. Meeting each others' friends, too (aka socializing with different generations), can be stimulating and empowering for both parties. Explore each others' worlds by trying new things, meeting new people, and being more involved in each others' lives.

					They have to have a sense of humor and be comfortable discussing the pitfalls. I also think it works well when the younger partner is very mature for his/her age, and the older partner is playful and perhaps a bit immature.
				</p><br>

				<p>
					No matter what the age difference, you both have to accept each other for who you are, including all those things that drive you absolutely bonkers (remembering that the grass is always greener until you get to that side; that's when you realize it has its own weeds). It's about compromise, being honest and communicative about what you're feeling, and every now and then doing something you'd rather not (or wouldn't normally) do.
